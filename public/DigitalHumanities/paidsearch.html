        <h1>Paid Search</h1>
        <p>
            People tend not to like ads while they're in the middle of doing something, so advertisers started aiming to steal customers from the very beginning, instead of trying
            to interrupt them with a sales pitch. The most obvious way to do this is targetting search engines. If someone's looking to buy a new car, especially if they're less
            tech savvy, they will most likely open up a search engine, search up car, and click on the very first result. If you're the second result, or lord forbid you're on the
            second page, you're going to get a fraction of the clicks that the first result does. GoTo.com capitalized on this need by allowing people to bid on placements for
            keywords. The highest bidder on the car keyword would always have their link at the very top. Eventually, though, they changed it from pay-for-placement to pay-per-click.
            Now instead of bidding for the placement, advertisers would bid based on how much they would pay per click.
