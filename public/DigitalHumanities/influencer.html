        <h1>Sponsored influencers</h1>
        <p>
            Nowadays, especially after Covid, people are very attached to their favorite influencers. YouTubers in particular, there is a large focus on authenticity, and in
            general people trust their favorite YouTubers a lot. And as such, when they recommend that you buy a product, you're much more likely to buy the product they
            recommend over a competing product. Advertisers know this and spend millions of dollars sponsoring YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and oftentimes even Tiktokers,
            and it's extremely effective.
