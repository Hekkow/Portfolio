        <h1>Targetted ads appear</h1>
        <p>
            WebConnect, an online ad agency at the time, started giving advertisers specific websites that they should advertise on, based off what they believe their customers
            would also be browsing through. So for example, they would place ads for a new game on a gaming website instead of a website dedicated to helping mothers through pregnancy.
            They also implemented some other features, such as capping the number of times a user would see an ad so that they don't become numb to it.
