        <h1>First clickable ad</h1>
        <p>
            The first ever clickable banner ad appeared on October 27, 1994. It appeared at the very top of HotWired, which was a part of Wired at the time. They were paid $30,000 by AT&T to place
the ad on their website for three months. The ad had a click through rate of 44%, with the average today being 0.06%. It was originally not meant to sell anything,
only to take people on a virtual trip.
