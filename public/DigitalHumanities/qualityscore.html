        <h1>Quality Score</h1>
        <p>
            There were two main problems with GoTo.com's system. The first was that viewers couldn't tell which results were ads and which were legit. This is a problem for users
            because if they realize the website they're on is actually a sneaky ad, they'll get annoyed, and that's a problem for advertisers because the users are annoyed with their
            product. The other problem is that it's possible for one advertiser to outbid another advertiser even though the higher paying advertiser's website is much less relevant
            to the keyboard, and thus gains a lot less traction. Google attempted to fix both of these problems with AdWords. They clearly marked ads as "sponsored". And they also
            implemented a Quality Score. The Quality Score is largely determined by an ad's clickrate. If an ad has a particularly high Quality Score, it has the possibility of being
            placed higher than a higher bidder with a lower Quality Score. This allowed for better results and incentivized advertisers to focus on creating more targetted ads instead
            of just paying more.
