        <h1>ROI tracking</h1>
        <p>
            At that time, there was no way of knowing if your ad was performing well. You could have the greatest ad ever and lose all the customers because of your website, or you
            could have an incredible website with nobody clicking on your ads because you're selling accounting services to children. There was no way to differentiate between
            the two. In order to fix that, Doubleclick created a ROI (return on investment) tool called D.A.R.T., or Dynamic Advertising Reporting and Targetting. It enabled
            advertisers to see exactly how many times people saw or clicked their ads, specific to each website. They could do this during the ad campaign too, so instead of
            wasting money on an underperforming ad, they'd simple tweak it or move it somewhere else entirely. With the newfound ability to measure the clickthrough rate of ads
            came a new measurement, CPM, or cost per impression. This measurement is still used often to this day.
