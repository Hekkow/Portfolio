        <h1>Hyper targetted ads</h1>
        <p>
            In 2006 Facebook got into the advertisement business as well. They switched the focus entirely from showing as many ads as possible to showing a few, ultra targetted ads.
            Instead of seeing hundreds of ads for things that are irrelevant and learning to ignore them better and better over time, you'd now see a few ads for the things
            Facebook determined that you are really interested in. Facebook would guess what you like based off the groups you're in, the people you follow, etc., and bank everything
            on you wanting something associated with those. This quickly spread to every social media.
