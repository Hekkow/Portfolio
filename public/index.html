                <template #title>Chat App</template>
                <template #text>
                    I built a chat app. It's a bit ugly but it's mine.
                    I had to get creative to circumvent the fact that I'm broke and can't afford storage or marketing.
                    So instead of wasting the precious little storage on profile pictures, I built a system for
                    creating profile pictures that takes virtually no storage but can still express the user's creativity.
                    To get around my lack of design skills, I built a theme editor to allow the user to design their own website.
                    Initially I was building it with raw JavaScript but it made me hate my life so I switched to Vue.js
                    and the world instantly got its color back. I used Node.js with Express/WebSockets for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.
                    It's optimized to run well on the slowest laptop I've ever seen.

                <template #text>
                    I'm currently a student of computer science at Carleton University. Born and raised in Canada. I've been coding for as long as I can remember,
                    making ugly little websites as gifts for my friends. Aside from programming, I enjoy gaming and reading and eating.

                <template #title>My thoughts on AI</template>
                <template #text>
                    I can't speak for the future, maybe one day I'll be the slave to an omnipotent AI, but for now, AI can't create a better product than a human can.
                    It can crank out tiny Python programs much faster than I can, but anything beyond that and it's useless. I don't like our current obsession with AI. It can be
                    a useful tool, but I find it disgusting when anyone tries to remove the human element entirely and replace it with AI.
